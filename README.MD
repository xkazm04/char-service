# Character Creator API Service

A FastAPI-based backend service for AI-powered character asset analysis and generation. This service provides intelligent image analysis, character metadata extraction, and 3D asset generation capabilities for game development and digital content creation.

## 🎯 Business Overview

The Character Creator API enables developers and content creators to:

- **Analyze Character Assets**: Upload images and extract detailed metadata about characters, including appearance, style, and attributes
- **Multi-Model AI Analysis**: Leverage OpenAI GPT-4 Vision and Google Gemini for comprehensive image understanding
- **3D Asset Generation**: Generate 3D meshes and models using Meshy API integration
- **Asset Management**: Store, search, and organize character assets with MongoDB Atlas
- **Background Processing**: Automated polling and status tracking for long-running generation tasks

### Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Multi-model approach using OpenAI and Google Gemini
- 🎨 **Image Processing**: Character asset detection and metadata extraction
- 🧊 **3D Generation**: Integration with Meshy API for 3D model creation
- 📊 **Asset Search**: Vector-based similarity search using MongoDB Atlas
- ⚡ **Async Processing**: Fast, concurrent request handling with FastAPI
- 🔍 **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and logging
- 🐳 **Container Ready**: Docker support for easy deployment
